#Workflow
## R Projects
---
# R projects
- Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project.

- Keep data files and scripts there.

- Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there.

- Only ever use relative paths, not absolute paths.

# Wrangle
![](data-science-wrangle.png)
- Data Transformation
  - Mulitiple datasets
  - Strings
  - Factors
  - Date and times
???
Import your data

Format it for usability in R

Transform your data to prepare it for whatever you want to do with it

#Tibbles

#What are Tibbles
- ####Data frames with different features to make life easier
- ####Most functions in tidyverse produce a tibble as output
---
# How to create tibbles
Included in tidyverse library, or seperately using `library(tibble)`
.pull-left[
Using `as_tibble()`
```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
as_tibble(cars)
```

]

--

.pull-right[
From individual vectors
```{r}
tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = 1, 
  z = x ^ 2 + y
)
```

]
---
# How to create tibbles


.pull-left[
Using **non-syntactic** names
```{r}
tb <- tibble(
  `:)` = "smile", 
  ` ` = "space",
  `2000` = "number"
)
tb
```

]

--
.pull-right[
Using tribble(), short for **tr**ansposed tibble
```{r}
tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  #--|--|----
  "a", 2, 3.6,
  "b", 1, 8.5
)
```

#Tibble vs Data Frames - Printing
Tibble shows only the first 10 rows, and all the columns that fit on screen
```{r}
as_tibble(nycflights13::flights)
```
---
#Tibble vs Data Frames - Subsetting
- Extract by name
```{r}
cars$speed
```

- Extract by position
  - `cars[[1]]`

- Using in pipe 
  - `cars %>% .x$speed`
  
####Tibbles also do much less than dataframes
  - *They never do partial matching* (stricter than dataframes)
  - They never change input type (so, no default converts strings to factors!), 
  - They never change the names of variables
  - They never create row names
